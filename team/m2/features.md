# Application Features

## Job Application Tracker

This feature will display an overview of each application submitted by the user, including key details such as company name, position, and the date of when the user applied. For each application, users can select their current status, such as "Applied," "Interviewing," "Offer," or "Rejected." Users will have the ability to update the status of each application. This functionality will give users a quick view of their progress, allowing them not to have to sort through various websites and emails.

## Job Search and Interviewing Tips Repository

A section that offers tips about the job search and interview process, tailored to each stage of the application. For example, users in the "Interviewing" stage, could reference behavioral interview tips, while someone in the "Applied" stage could reference tips discussing how to follow up. This would help users at each stage of the process.
